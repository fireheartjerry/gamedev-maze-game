# Maze Game
Maze Game Repo for Game Dev Club

## Description
Repo that holds the source code (python, written with pygame), for a fun maze game that is planned to be made for MGCI Game Dev Club.

First, pygame is initiated, with some default colours such as red, black or white. We also setup different lists relating to different levels of a maze.

Then some other things happen which we will explain in much more depth in the club sessions.

## imgreader.py
This is a map maker program. The prompts will guide you through the usage of this program.
Wall types:
- "win": green colour, win the level
- "lose": red colour, if the player touches this they will reset
- "ice": aqua colour, makes player go faster and hard to control
